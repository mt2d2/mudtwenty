#summary JVM flags for increased performance
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =
The JVM has many flags which can affect the performance of a Java application, specifically servers. If we deploy this application, we might find many of these flags useful (for one, the JVM already starts in -server mode for Server). See [http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/hotspot/vmoptions.jsp Sun's documentation] on the subject for future reference.
