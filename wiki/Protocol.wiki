#summary How should the clients communicate with the server?

= Introduction =

There are basically two ideas: send serialized java objects, or send plain text strings of what the user types. What are the arguments for either way of doing things?

----

I (Quinten) advocate sending only plain text and not java objects. Here are my reasons:

 * Flexibility of client choice. Using plain text allows players to use any MUD client they want, or just telnet. This is a Good Thing.
 * Standard convention. Other MUDs just send plain text.
 * Reduce coupling. Any changes to Message objects requires changes in both the server and the client. This also creates a problem where old versions of clients will not work.
 * I contend that it's totally unnecessary to send serialized java objects rather than text. All of the parsing and such can be carried out on the server side.
