#summary Unresolved questions (or minor issues) needing answers

There's more than one thing that needs to be discussed. List any questions that are unresolved here. (I'm also going to note down any random comments or concerns that occur to me here --Quinten)

It might be convenient to discuss major issues on a newsgroup, like the one at <http://groups.google.com/group/mudtwenty>.

 * Which network port can we use?
 * Is there a test server we deploy on for home use?
 * Data storage? vs Everything in memory?

Provide a common interface for sending messages (tell, say) to all types of Creatures.
