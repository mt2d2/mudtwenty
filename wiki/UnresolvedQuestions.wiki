#summary Unresolved questions needing answers

There's more than one thing that needs to be discussed. List any questions that are unresolved here.

  * Which network port can we use?
  * Is there a test server we deploy on for home use?
  * Data storage? vs Everything in memory?
  * Which extra credit?
  * Design patterns?

It might be convenient to discuss major issues on a newsgroup, like the one at <http://groups.google.com/group/mudtwenty>.

----

 * Abstract class or interface for creature?
   * Where should what methods be?
 * `Map<String,Int>` or `List<Skill>` for skills?
 * String or enum for direction?
 * For sending colored messages to clients: should we use the current method (`Color` class) or send ANSI colored text?
   * The spec suggests ANSI, this is how other MUDs do it, and it would work if we sent it to a client connected through another MUD cient.
