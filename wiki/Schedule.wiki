= Major things to do =

We really have to focus on just the most important things for getting a good grade on this assignment, as our time is extremely limited. Some of the major things to do include:
 * Populating the world with items, monsters, descriptions
   * I think that we will have to make YAML work before we can do this quickly.
 * MOBs and MOB AI
   * I have a few ideas about this that I will try to start in the next day or so.
