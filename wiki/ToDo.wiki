#summary Things that need to be done by tonight!

= Introduction =

We need to get this working tonight; we will be presenting it to Jan at 4pm Friday.

Add anything to this list that you think needs to be done!

Also: Our UML is out of sync with our code. It's not very useful to consult. Instead, you should consult our javadoc, which is hosted at http://qeny.net/javadoc/ currently.

== What needs to work? ==

A user must be able to connect to the server, create a character, and use that character to move between rooms. Then, it must be possible for another player to connect, create a player and talk to the other player. Ideally, the player should also be able to look at and pick up items.

= Details =

 * We need to decide where and how Universe is going to be loaded.
   * It makes sense that it should be loaded in Server when it starts, but Universe is singleton so there might be an issue.
   * Maybe universe should not be singleton, but then it would be harder to access the Universe's player to room map.
   * Maybe Universe should try loading the world itself when new Universe() is called. This seems the simplest option to me.
 * A default universe (consisting of a couple rooms with simple names/descriptions) should be created.
