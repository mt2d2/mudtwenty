Short version: http://qeny.net/javadoc/

Long version:It's useful to have the javadoc of our project to look at to get an idea of what's going on. But since we don't have it in our repository and it might be inconvenient to generate it and look at it every time one wants to see it, I'll be hosting it for now, at http://qeny.net/javadoc. Of course, this will only sometimes be in sync with the actual code. Might be useful though.
